# inf-1.5

INF V1.5 (aka [S](https://github.com/igneous-labs/S)). Reworked SDKs and incremental program upgrades.

## Why new repo?

v1 solana SDKs were obstructing development so much that it was just easier to start from scratch.

Most of the [docs relating to architecture and design in the old repo](https://github.com/igneous-labs/S/tree/master/docs) are still relevant and should be read prior.

## solana toolchain vers
