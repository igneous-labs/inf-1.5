The main INF program entrypoint.

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as the INF controller program, is in fact, the INF controller/peripheral programs, or as I've recently taken to calling it, the INF program suite. The INF controller program is not a dapp unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning INF system made useful by the pricing programs, sol value calculator programs and vital system components comprising a full dapp as defined by Solana.
